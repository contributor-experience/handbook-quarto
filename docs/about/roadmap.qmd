**0 to 0.1 Roadmap**

*June 2024*

The Contributor Experience Project roadmap captures current development priorities 
within the project and should serve as a guide for the core team, encourage and inspire 
contributors, and provide insights to the broader open source community. For details on 
the purpose of this document, refer to the About roadmap section.
The mission of Contributor Experience Project is *TBD* 
(see https://github.com/contributor-experience/handbook/issues/89)... 

To work towards this mission, we have set the following priorities for the upcoming months:
- TBD
- TBD
- TBD

These priorities were selected based on the [issue tracker]
(https://github.com/contributor-experience/handbook/issues) and feedback submitted at the 
[community calls](https://github.com/contributor-experience/archive). 

Once the above goals are met, we will review the roadmap to identify new priorities.
